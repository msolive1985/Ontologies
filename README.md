We have developed a new multimodal interaction mapping framework for 3D object manipulation that provides a simple way of getting inputs from joysticks, gamepads, and other game controllers to many different specific systems including industrial applications within the petroleum, geology and materials sciences.

We are finishing the ;as details to be install in pip and also the manual of the things you can do. At the moment, it works in Unity 3D and Drishti ANU visualization software.

Note: you need to have access to the ontology that uses for the mapping!
